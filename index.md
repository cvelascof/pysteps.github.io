# Welcome to pySTEPS!

The pySTEPS initiative is a community that develops and maintains an easy to use, modular, free and open source python framework for short-term, ensemble prediction systems (STEPS).

The focus is on precipitation nowcasting, but pySTEPS is designed to allow a wider range of uses.

## Quick-start guide
It is very easy to start using and contributing to pySTEPS! The only thing you need to do is to download the github repositories of the needed pySTEPS modules. You proceed as follows:
1. Create a "pySTEPS" directory in your home folder or server ("mkdir pySTEPS" in linux). Enter the directory ("cd pySTEPS" in linux).
2. Download the set of pySTEPS modules ("cd pySTEPS" in linux). In linux you would run these commands:
pySTEPS_URL=https://github.com/pySTEPS
git clone $pySTEPS_URL/tutorials
git clone $pySTEPS_URL/iotools
git clone $pySTEPS_URL/datatools
git clone $pySTEPS_URL//motion
git clone $pySTEPS_URL/stepsnwc
etc
Important: each pySTEPS module is put into a different repository. This should simplify the maintainability of the code and promote its usage also beyond precipitation nowcasting.

pySTEPS supports Python 2.7 and requires the installation of Anaconda 2.7 for the various libraries. You proceed as follows:
1. Download the appropriate Anaconda2.7 for your platform: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2.
