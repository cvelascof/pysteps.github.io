# Welcome to pySTEPS!

The pySTEPS initiative is a community that develops and maintains an easy to use, modular, free and open source python framework for short-term, ensemble prediction systems (STEPS).

The focus is on precipitation nowcasting, but pySTEPS is designed to allow a wider range of uses.
